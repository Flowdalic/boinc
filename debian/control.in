@ Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run

@ .
@ The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
@ manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
@ available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
@ some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
@ a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
@ with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
@ saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
@ again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
@ the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
@ the manager.
@ .
@ This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
@ effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
@ Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
@ it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
@ processes running on the same core.

@Description: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
@ The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
@ software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
@ resources.
@ .
@ This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
@ control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
@ overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, as there are
@  * attached projects
@  * running tasks
@  * file transfers between the client and project servers
@  * statistics about granted credits and disk usage for every project
@  * constraints on CPU usage
@ The BOINC Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which
@ it only displays the most important information and the "Advanced View"
@ in which all information and all control elements are available.
@ .
@ For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
@ boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
@ machine contributing.
