Description: core client for the BOINC distributed computing infrastructure
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC core client program that is required to
 participate in any project that uses BOINC.  A central server distributes
 work units and collects results via this client.  When attaching a
 local machine to a project, this client will also dynamically download
 the projects application's program to be then wrapped by the BOINC
 core client.
