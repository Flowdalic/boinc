Description: core client for the BOINC distributed computing infrastructure
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of various
 scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of desktop computers.
 The developers' web site at the University of Berkeley serves as a common
 portal to the otherwise independently run projects.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC core client program that is required to
 participate in any project that uses BOINC.  A central server distributes
 work units and collects results via this client.  When attaching a
 local machine to a project, this client will also dynamically download
 the projects application's program to be then wrapped by the BOINC
 core client.

Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: boinc-client
Description: GUI to control and monitor the BOINC core client
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and
 control utility for the BOINC core client. It gives a detailed
 overview of the state of the client it is monitoring, for example it
 shows attached projects, running tasks or file transfers between the
 client and project servers. It also shows statistics about granted
 credits and disk usage of the client and the projects. The BOINC
 Manager has two modes of operation, the "Simple View" in which it only
 displays the most important information and the "Advanced View" in
 which all information and all control elements are available.
 .
 For active participation in any BOINC project the recommended
 boinc-client package, not the boinc-manager, is required for every
 machine contributing.

Description: development files to build applications for BOINC projects
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
