Scripts in this folder are a contribution by SZTAKI group
in Budapest who run http://www.desktopgrid.hu . We aim at
merging our efforts in providing Debian packages.

A series of developments of SZTAKI are important to their
development but unlikely to be merged with upstream. Others
are important to them and likely to be adopted over time.

Debian shall contribute to the merging of upstream and
SZTAKI development by collecting all patches aiming at
upstream integration within its debian folder on the master
branch. The SZTAKI-specific developments will also move
into the Debian folder - but remain in their separate
branch.
