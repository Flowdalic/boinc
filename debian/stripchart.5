.SH NOTES
  * TIME either unix date, julian date, or civil date in the form:
      YYYY:MM:DD:HH:MM (year, month, day, hour, minute)
    If you enter something with colons, it assumes it is civil date
    If you have a decimal point, it assumes it is julian date
    If it is an integer, it assumes it is unix date (epoch seconds)
    If it is a negative number, it is in decimal days from current time
      (i.e. \-2.5 = two and a half days ago)
    * All times on command line are assumed to be "local" times
    * All times in the data file must be in unix date (epoch seconds)
  * RANGE is given in decimal days (i.e. 1.25 = 1 day, 6 hours)
  * if LINES == 0, (i.e. \-l 0) then the whole data file is read in
  * columns (given with \-x, \-y, \-Y flags) start at 1
  * titles given with \-T can contain the following key words which will
    be converted:
      FILE - basename of input file
      RANGE - pretty civil date range (in local time zone)
    the default title is: FILE RANGE
