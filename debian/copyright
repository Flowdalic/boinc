 This package was first debianized by Steffen Moeller <moeller@debian.org>
 on Sat, 13 Nov 2004 23:28:53 +0100. Since Wed, 26 Jan 2005 it is maintained
 by the Debian BOINC Maintainers <pkg-boinc-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>.
 .
 BOINC releases are not distributed as tarballs, but suitable .orig.tar.gz
 files can be constructed by exporting the source code from upstream's VCS.
 Refer to the paragraph "Repackaged upstream source" in debian/README.source
 for how the Debian BOINC Maintainers do this.

           Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
 .
           (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial
           Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the
           Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that
           any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize
           the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater
           extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
           combinations.
 .
      2.2. Contributor Grant.
      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
      claims:

           (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
           distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or

           Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and
 .
           (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
           Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions
           thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is
           reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor
           Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that
           may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.
 .
 3. Distribution Obligations.
 .
      3.1. Application of License.
      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
      only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
      License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
      License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
      restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
      rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
      offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
 .
      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
 .
      3.3. Description of Modifications.
      You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a
      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
 .
      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
 .
           (a) Third Party Claims.
           If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property
           right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization
           under this License), you must include a text file with the source
           code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and
           the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient
           will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You
           make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You
           shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
           available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
           appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
           inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
           been obtained.
 .
           (b) Contributor APIs.
           If Your Modification is an application programming interface and
           You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
           implement that API, you must also include this information in the
           LEGAL file.
 .
      3.5. Required Notices.
      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
      Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where
      You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You
      created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible
      to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
      structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a
      relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such
      a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
      of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and
      not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must
      make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
      liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
      indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
      incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
      Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in
      an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
      distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
      Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
      provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
      that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
      or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the
      rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
      that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
      not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
      indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
      incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
      any such terms You offer.
 .
      3.7. Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
 .
      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute
      or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
      to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
      the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL
      file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
      distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
      statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
      for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Application of this License.
 .
      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
      attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.
 .
 6. Versions of the License.
 .
      6.1. New Versions.
      Netscape Communications Corporation (``Netscape'') may publish revised
      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
      be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
      Covered Code created under this License.
 .
      6.3. Derivative Works.
      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
      governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that the
      phrases ``Mozilla'', ``MOZILLAPL'', ``MOZPL'', ``Netscape'', ``NPL'' or
      any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license
      and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license
      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
      Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
      not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
 .
 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 .
      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8. TERMINATION.
 .
      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
      shall survive.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 .
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
      PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
      OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
      GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
      ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
      BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT
      EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
 .
      The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in
      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer
      software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such
      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
      rights set forth herein.
 .
 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
 .
      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
      provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
      respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
      entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of
      America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating
      to this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual
      property rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration,
      with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any
      arbitration relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara
      County, California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any
      litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the
      jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
      California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with
      the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
      court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application
      of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
      Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
      provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
      drafter shall not apply to this License.
 .
 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
 .
      Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
      Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
      indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
      on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the
      revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant
      factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute
      responsibility on an equitable basis.
