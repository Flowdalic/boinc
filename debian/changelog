    - Improved the short description of all three packages. Thanks to
      Martin Schulze for his suggestions. (closes: #359332)
  * debian/patches/:
    - Removed 01_amd64-gcc4-fixes.dpatch, it was applied upstream.

boinc (5.2.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Call configure properly with the --build and --host switches as
      described in autotools-dev's README.Debian.
    - Remove *.unmodified binaries in the clean target, because those files
      are not removed by make distclean. This is needed to rebuild the
      packages in an already used source tree.
    - Update config.guess and config.sub from the autotools-dev package to add
      support for GNU/k*BSD.
  * debian/patches/:
    - Added 10_exclude-sea.dpatch to prevent building the self-extracting
      archive, since we don't need it in any case and this fixes a FTBFS on
      non-Linux hosts.
    - Modified 03_wx2.6-with-unicode.dpatch to fix Alioth bug #303021.
      Thanks to Steven Altermatt for the bug report.
  * Fixed FTBFS with G++ 4.1, thanks to Martin Michlmayr. (closes: #358650)

boinc (5.2.15-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uploaded to Debian (closes: #281890).
  
  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * Added boinc-manager.README.Debian to explain how to set the web browser
    that the BOINC Manager uses.
  * Added the conffile "remote_hosts.cfg" to "/etc/boinc-client/". Old files
    are handled the same way as old "gui_rpc_auth.cfg" files.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Thu, 26 Jan 2006 19:25:20 +0100

boinc (5.2.15-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/patches/:
    - Added 07_use-sensible-browser.dpatch. The BOINC Manager now uses
      "sensible-browser", which is part of the debianutils package, as
      fallback if wxWidgets' method to determine the default browser fails.
      Thanks to Olek Wojnar for the report and his helpful investigations.
  * debian/boinc-client.postrm: 
    - Be more verbose when removing the "boinc" user/group.
  * debian/boinc-manager.desktop:
    - Added "Path: /var/lib/boinc-client" so that the BOINC Manager can find
      the "gui_rpc_auth.cfg" file and does not ask for a password. This should
      be removed when the BOINC Manager is able to store passwords in its
      config file.
  * debian/control:
    - Added an extra space before the "Homepage" pseudo field according to the
      Developer's Reference, Section 6.2.4.
    - Added Christoph Martin <christoph.martin@uni-mainz.de> and
      Greg Norris <adric@debian.org> to Uploaders.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Added more copyright and license information for various files.
  * Created symlinks of headers and static libraries, which are required to
    build the SETI@home application, in "/usr/share/boinc-dev/".
  * Ship a default "gui_rpc_auth.cfg" file in "/etc/boinc-client/" and create
    a symlink in "/var/lib/boinc-client" to this file. Old "gui_rpc_auth.cfg"
    files are moved to "/etc/boinc-client/" before creating the symlink.

    - Updated 01_amd64-gcc4-fixes.dpatch for the new release. 
    - Updated 03_wx2.6-with-unicode.dpatch for the new release.

  * Record versions of build dependencies at compile-time using dh_buildinfo.
  * Updated MySQL (build) dependencies to "libmysqlclient15-dev" and
    "mysql-server-5.0".

boinc (5.2.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Sun,  6 Nov 2005 12:19:57 +0100

boinc (5.2.4-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/patches/:
    - Added 01_amd64-gcc4-fixes.dpatch again, it is still needed to compile
      BOINC on AMD64.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Sat, 22 Oct 2005 16:13:55 +0200

boinc (5.2.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/patches/:
    - Removed obsolete 01_amd64-gcc4-fixes.dpatch.
    - Updated 02_wx2.6-configure.ac.dpatch for new release.
    - Updated 03_wx2.6-with-unicode.dpatch for new release.
  * debian/control:
    - Add zlib1g-dev, libssl-dev and libcurl3-openssl-dev to Build-Depends.
    - Build depend on the newer libmysqlclient14-dev package since
      libmysqlclient12-dev is scheduled to be removed.
    - Moved all packages back to main. Non-free code (RSAEuro and GLUT) has
      been removed from BOINC.
    - Added ${misc:Depends} to all packages' Depends. This variable is not
      used at the moment.
    - Use a versioned dependency for lsb-base (>= 3.0-6) to ensure that the
      log_progress_msg function is available. (fixes: Alioth bug #302179)
  * debian/copyright:
    - Added copyright and license information for various PHP libraries
      found in html/inc/.
    - Added the full text of the Mozilla Public License 1.0 since stripchart
      is distributed under the MPL.
    - Removed RSAEuro and GLUT copyright and license information since this
      code was removed upstream.
  * debian/rules:
    - Rewrote debian/rules without CDBS. CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS are now forwarded
      to the build process.
    - Compile only the BOINC core client program with "-O3 -ffast-math".
    - Remove all files that are created by the autotools during the
      pre-build target in the clean target.
  * debian/boinc-client.postinst:
    - If the file "/var/lib/boinc-client/gui_rpc_auth.cfg" does not exist,
      create an empty one and make it readable by everyone. This allows
      every user on the same host to control the core client with GUI RPCs
      (eg. with "boincmgr" or "boinc_cmd").
  * The boinc-dev package now only includes headers and static libraries, that
    are installed by "make install". According to Bruce Allen this should be
    sufficient for building BOINC applications.
    (http://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/pipermail/boinc_dev/2005-October/003855.html)
  * Removed all references to RSAEuro from the boinc-dev package.
  * Added boinc-client.README.Debian that replaces boinc-client's previous
    NEWS file and explains how to use the BOINC core client in Debian.
  * Added icon to BOINC Manager's desktop file. (fixes: Alioth bug #302212)
  * Updated boincmgr.xml manpage and watch file.

boinc (4.72-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * Patched the BOINC Manager so that it compiles with Debian's experimental
    wxWidgets version 2.6.1 (see: 03_wxwidgets_with_unicode.patch).
  * Install "BOINC Manager.mo" files under /usr/share/locale/.
  * Use LSB init-functions for the boinc-client init script and add lsb-base
    dependency to boinc-client.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added libjpeg62-dev to Build-Depends.
    - boinc-manager properly conflicts with and replaces now the old boinc-gui
      package. The experimental state of this package was a lame excuse for
      not providing a smooth upgrade path in 4.27-1.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Sat, 13 Aug 2005 17:50:58 +0200

boinc (4.72-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "You are a credit junkie!" release.
  * New upstream release.
  
  [ Frank S. Thomas ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Set default C/C++ compiler flags to "-g -O3 -ffast-math".
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added missing build dependencies for the BOINC graphics API library
      (libsm-dev, libice-dev, libxi-dev, libx11-dev).

  [ Steffen Moeller ]
  * debian/control.in:
    - Revised long description of the boinc-client package.
    - Added "boinc-manager | kboincspy" to boinc-client's Suggests field.

boinc (4.71-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Included the 'boinc_cmd' program into the boinc-client package. boinc_cmd
    is a command tool that provides an interactive command-line interface to
    the BOINC core client.
  * Created maintainer scripts to create/remove the '/var/lib/boinc-client'
    working directory and the system user/group 'boinc'.
  * Improved the boinc-client.init script and also removed the check for
    uninitialized working directories (no client_state.xml file).
  * Added .desktop file for the BOINC Manager program, thanks to Reed Hedges.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added docbook-xml to Build-Depends. Without it this package FTBFS
      (particularly docbook2x-man fails) on some systems. Thanks to 
      Adrian Zaugg for the report.
    - Added libxmu-dev and freeglut3-dev (instead of the virtual package
      freeglut-dev) to Build-Depends. Both are needed for the graphical parts
      of the BOINC API library.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Wed, 20 Jul 2005 23:54:37 +0200

boinc (4.70-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Built with g++-4.0.
  * debian/boinc-client.init:
    - Added status option to init.d script as proposed in Debian bug #291148.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Removed Build-Conflicts on automake1.4 and automake1.6, because we invoke
      aclocal-1.9 and automake-1.9 in debian/rules directly now.
    - Bumped Standards-Version from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2, no changes required.
  * debian/rules:
    - Use 'i686-linux-gnu' as default DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE on 'i486-linux-gnu'.
      It is still possible to override DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE with the
      BOINC_BUILD_TYPE variable.
    - Added '--enable-client' and '--enable-server' as configure flags.
  * Added missing options to boinc-client manpage.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Thu,  7 Jul 2005 18:00:03 +0200

boinc (4.45a-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Moved all packages into non-free section, because RSAEuro's license
      does not comply with DFSG #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of
      Endeavor). The RSAEuro license is included in debian/copyright.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Fri, 10 Jun 2005 16:39:21 +0200

boinc (4.40-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Disabled the boinc-manager package, because it build depends on
    wxWidgets 2.6 which is not in Debian yet.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added Steffen Moeller and myself to Uploaders.
    - Build-Depend on libmysqlclient12-dev instead of the virtual package
      libmysqlclient-dev.
  * debian/boinc-manager.menu:
    - Added BOINC, Science and Monitoring to the 'hints' field.

 -- Frank S. Thomas <frank@thomas-alfeld.de>  Fri, 13 May 2005 23:30:01 +0200

boinc (4.27-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added automake1.9 and autoconf (>> 2.52) to Build-Depends.
    - Added automake1.6 to Build-Conflicts.
  * Renamed boinc-gui package to boinc-manager. The BOINC manager binary was
    renamed from 'boinc_gui' to 'boincmgr', the BOINC core client binary was
    renamed to 'boinc'. This package is still experimental, so boinc-manager
    does not replace (or conflict with) boinc-gui.
  * debian/rules:
    - The BOINC_BUILD_TYPE environment variable can be used to specify
      DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE in debian/rules. This is an interim solution for
      the "platform '...' not found" problem.
    - Create symlinks of BOINC libraries and header files under
      /usr/share/boinc/ in the boinc-dev package.

boinc (4.25-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Provides now the boinc-gui package, which contains the BOINC manager, a
    graphical monitoring utility for the core client.
  * Revised the boinc_client manpage and added the boinc_gui manpage. Manpages
    are now created with the docbook2x-man tool.
  * debian/control: 
    - Added build dependences on libmysqlclient-dev, freeglut-dev,
      libwxgtk2.4-dev and docbook2x.
    - Added build conflict with automake1.4.
    - Changed section from "science" to "net" (boinc-client), "x11" (boinc-gui)
      and "devel" (boinc-dev).
