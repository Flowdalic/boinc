    - Added status option to init.d script as proposed in Debian bug #291148.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Removed Build-Conflicts on automake1.4 and automake1.6, because we invoke
      aclocal-1.9 and automake-1.9 in debian/rules directly now.
    - Bumped Standards-Version from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2, no changes required.

boinc (4.45a-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Moved all packages into non-free section, because RSAEuro's license
      does not comply with DFSG #6 (No Discrimination Against Fields of
      Endeavor). The RSAEuro license is included in debian/copyright.

boinc (4.40-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Disabled the boinc-manager package, because it build depends on
    wxWidgets 2.6 which is not in Debian yet.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added Steffen Moeller and myself to Uploaders.
    - Build-Depend on libmysqlclient12-dev instead of the virtual package
      libmysqlclient-dev.
  * debian/boinc-manager.menu:
    - Added BOINC, Science and Monitoring to the 'hints' field.

boinc (4.27-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added automake1.9 and autoconf (>> 2.52) to Build-Depends.
    - Added automake1.6 to Build-Conflicts.
  * Renamed boinc-gui package to boinc-manager. The BOINC manager binary was
    renamed from 'boinc_gui' to 'boincmgr', the BOINC core client binary was
    renamed to 'boinc'. This package is still experimental, so boinc-manager
    does not replace (or conflict with) boinc-gui.
  * debian/rules:
    - The BOINC_BUILD_TYPE environment variable can be used to specify
      DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE in debian/rules. This is an interim solution for
      the "platform '...' not found" problem. 
    - Create symlinks of BOINC libraries and header files under
      /usr/share/boinc/ in the boinc-dev package.
